# ARM assembly highlighting for Atom

Adds syntax highlighting for the ARM Assembly language to Atom.

## Install

To install the package language-arm:

* In Atom: (Preferences->Packages)
* Shell: `$ apm install language-arm`

## TODO

This is a quickly knocked together version of the syntax highlighting package found in Package Control for Sublime Text but has been rewritten in places to make it a bit cleaner! There are still some things missing and it could do with an entire refactor! Feel free to report issues or submit pull requests.
